# clustering_project
Clustering project is a an artifical inteligence project with a goal of implementing and analyzing three major data clustering algorithms
The algorithms used in the project are:
- DB Scan
- K-Means
- hierarchical clustering

For analyzing we have used following data sets:
- [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine)
- [Yeast dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/110/yeast)
- [E-coli dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/39/ecoli)

Libraries used: `numpy`,`sklearn`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
