# clustering-algorithms-analysis
Clustering Algorithms Analysis is a an artifical intelligence project with a goal of implementing and analyzing three major data clustering algorithms.

The algorithms used in the project are:
- DB Scan
- K-Means
- hierarchical clustering

For analyzing we have used following data sets:
- [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine)
- [Yeast dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/110/yeast)
- [E-coli dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/39/ecoli)

Libraries used: 
 - `numpy`
 - `sklearn`
 - `pandas`
 - `matplotlib`

The report containing the analysis of clustring algorithms in polish version is available in `Clustering_Project.pdf` file.
